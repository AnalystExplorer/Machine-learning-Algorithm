# Project Title: Customer Purchase Prediction Model
# Description:
This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine customers' purchase intent using classification and boosting machine learning techniques. The dataset includes essential variables like age, gender, account balance, occupation, and credit-related information. The goal is to predict whether a customer is "Willing to Buy" (1) or "Not Willing to Buy" (0). Model evaluation is performed using ROC curves and confusion metrics to assess the model's predictive performance.
